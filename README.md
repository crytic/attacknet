# Attacknet

Blockchain networks in the wild are subject to a lot of real life variances that have historically been difficult to capture 
in local or controlled tests. Chaos testing is a disciplined approach to testing a system by proactively simulating and 
identifying failures. Attacknet is a tool that allows you to simulate these real life variances in a controlled environment.
Examples would include adding network latency between nodes, killing nodes at random, or filesystem latency.

The overall architecture of Attacknet relies on Kubernetes to run the workloads, [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) to orchestrate a blockchain network and
[Chaos Mesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/) to inject faults into nodes. Attacknet can then be configured to run healthchecks and 
reports back the state of the network at the end of a test.

### Capabilities

The faults supported by Attacknet include:
- Time based: Clock skew
- Network based: Split networks, Packet loss, corruption, latency, bandwidth throttling
- Container based: Restarting containers, killing containers
- Filesystem based: I/O latency, I/O errors
- Stress based: CPU stress, Memory stress
- (WIP) Kernel based: Kernel faults

Attacknet can be used in the following ways:
- Manually creating specific faults that target nodes matching a criteria
- Genesis devnets of specific topologies using [Kurtosis](https://www.kurtosis.com/), then run faults against them.
- Use the planner to define a matrix of faults and targets, automatically generating the network topology and fault configuration.
- (WIP) Exploratory testing. Dynamically generate various faults/targeting criterion and run faults continuously. 

See [DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md) for specific usage examples.

## Getting started
### Installation/Building

1. Install Go 1.21 or newer
2. In the project root, run `go build ./cmd/attacknet`
3. Copy the "attacknet" binary path to your PATH variable or directly invoke it

### Setting up the other bits

1. Set up a containerd k8s cluster. (1.27 or older), ideally without auto-scaling (as high provisioning time leads to timeouts on kurtosis) 
2. Authenticate to the cluster for kubectl
3. Install chaos-mesh
   1. `kubectl create ns chaos-mesh`
   2. `helm repo add chaos-mesh https://charts.chaos-mesh.org`
   3. `helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh -n=chaos-mesh --version 2.6.1 --set chaosDaemon.runtime=containerd --set chaosDaemon.socketPath=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --set dashboard.securityMode=false --set bpfki.create=true`
   4. To access chaos dashboard, use `kubectl --namespace chaos-mesh port-forward svc/chaos-dashboard 2333`
4. Install [kurtosis locally](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install)
5. Run `kurtosis cluster set cloud`, more information [here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s)
6. If running in digitalocean, edit the kurtosis-config.yml file from `kurtosis config path` and add the following setting under kubernetes-cluster-name: `storage-class: "do-block-storage"`
7. In a separate terminal, run `kurtosis engine start`
8. In a separate terminal, run `kurtosis gateway`. This process needs to stay alive during all attacknet testing and cannot be started via SDK.

## Changelog

**March 18, 2024 version v0.4**

First public release!

**New**
- Added two new configuration options in the test planner:
  - target_node_multiplier, which duplicates the number of nodes on the network containing the client under test
  - targets_as_percent_of_network, which adds more non-test nodes to the network to improve client diversity testing
- Added new fault options to the test planner:
  - Network latency faults
  - Network packet loss faults
- Beacon chain clients are now included in health checking.
 
**Fixed**
- Fixed an issue where the test planner's resultant network topology was non-deterministic
- Fixed an issue where a dropped port-forwarding connection to a pod may result in a panic
- Fixed an issue where Chaos Mesh would fail to find targets in networks with more than 10 nodes
- Updated for Kurtosis SDK v0.88.5

**Jan 30, 2024 version v0.3 (internal)**
- Fixed the demo example suite
- Fixed issues with the test planner and pod-restart faults.
- Added bootnode configuration for the test planner.
- Attack sizes in the test planner now refer to size in the context of the entire network. 
  - A supermajority-sized attack will try to target 66%+ nodes in the entire network, not just 66% of the nodes that match the test target criteria.
- Peer scoring is now disabled for all planner-generated network configurations.
- Bootnodes are no longer targetable by planner-generated test suites.

**Jan 11, 2024 version v0.2 (internal)**
- Updated to kurtosis v0.86.1
- Updated to Go 1.21
- Grafana port-forwarding has been temporarily disabled
- Introduces multi-step tests. This allows multiple faults and other actions to be composed into a single test.
- Introduces the suite planner. The suite planner allows the user to define a set of testing criteria/dimensions, which the planner turns into a suite containing multiple tests.
- Successful & failed test suites now emit test artifacts summarizing the results of the test.

**Dec 15, 2023 version v0.1 (internal)**
- Initial internal release
